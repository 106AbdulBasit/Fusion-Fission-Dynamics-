## Artificial Life with Robotics Projects

This repository contains the code for my Netlogo and Thymio robotics projects developed as part of my coursework for the course Artificial Life with Robotics.

The projects involve the creation of robots that can follow other robots, walk in flocks, and detect and avoid obstacles or lines. The robots have been programmed to divide their detection zones into three different layers: far sight, near sight, and perspective space. By changing the values of these variables, the robots are able to adapt their behavior, such as following other robots or walking in a flock of robots.

## Technologies Used

- Netlogo
- Thymio robotics platform

## Getting Started

To set up the projects on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/106AbdulBasit/Artificial-Life-with-Robotics-Projects.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Artificial-Life-with-Robotics-Projects`

## Running the Projects

To run a project, simply open the project file in Netlogo or Thymio robotics platform.
